# Exercism 
Exercism aims to provide opportunity for people of all backgrounds by helping them develop their programming skills through practice and mentorship. We provide thousands of exercises spread across over 50 language tracks, and offer both automated and human mentoring.

Exercism is 100% free. It is entirely open source and relies on the contributions of thousands of volunteers. Our platform is designed to be fun and friendly, and we place a strong emphasis on empathetic communication

### How Exercism works
Learning through Exercism is quite different to other programming websites, with a focus on individual practice and mentor-based learning. Here's how it works

1. Choose a language to master
Object oriented, functional, popular, emerging, or just plain obscure. With 50 different languages to explore, Exercism has something for you!

2. Complete a coding challenge on your computer
All the coding happens on your machine in an environment you're familiar with. Download the template, solve the problem, and then upload your solution

3. Upload your solution and review it with a mentor
Discussing code is one of the best ways to learn. Our friendly mentors will comment on your solutions online, introducing you to new ideas and techniques

4. Unlock different concepts and exercises
Our tracks have between 40 and 100 exercise each - some are fun, some are tricky, some are weird, but all will teach you something new


5. Complete the language track and achieve fluency
At the end of your language track you will have mastered the core concepts and idioms of your language and be ready to use it in the real world

## Getting Started
### Help! What do I do?
We know using a new product can be daunting, and Exercism is a little complicated. So here's a really simple set of instructions to get you started.

#### Sign up
1. Sign up at [exercism.io](https://exercism.io/) using either your GitHub account, or by using your email address and choose a password.
2. If you sign up using an email address, you now need to confirm it. Look for the email, click the link, then log in

#### Language and exercises
3. You will now see a list of all the [language tracks](https://exercism.io/tracks) you can join. You can click through as many as you want to explore

4. Once you've found a language you want to join, click the "Join Track" button.

5. You will now be taken into your new track. You'll see a core set of exercises at the top and some side-exercises below

6. Start with the first core exercise on the track, which is normally called "Hello World". Click on the exercise to begin

7. You will see some information and some instructions on the left-hand side and a button on the right-hand side labelled "Begin Walkthrough". Click on this and follow the instructions

#### Submit your solution, mentoring
8. You should now have the [CLI installed](#installing-the-exercism-cli) and the exercise downloaded to your computer. Solve the exercise and then upload it using 
```
> exercism submit /PATH/TO/SOLUTION
```

9. In your web-browser, go back to the language tracks page, choose your exercise and the exercise you've just worked on. You will now see your solution online and notice that it is awaiting a mentor

10. A mentor will now come and give you feedback on your solution. This can happen really quickly (15 minutes) or take a little while (a day or two) depending on demand. In the meantime, you will find other exercises on your track are available for you to solve!

#### Iterations, resubmit
11. Once you've received feedback, you can make some changes to your solution and then resubmit it (see step 8). This may happen a couple of times before the solution is approved

12. Once the solution is approved by a mentor, you click 'complete' to mark the solution completed. This will unlock lots more exercises

#### Get involved: mentoring or maintaining a track
13. You're now an Exercism pro! :)

14. Fancy giving back to Exercism and helping others? We always need more [mentors](http://mentoring.exercism.io/) and [track maintainers](https://exercism.io/become-a-maintainer) and we'd love you to get involved!

### Installing the Exercism CLI
The best way to get started with the CLI is to use our [Interactive Walkthrough](https://exercism.io/cli-walkthrough). That will take you down the right path depending on your operating system, experience with the command line, etc, and will get your CLI configured

If you just want to download the CLI manually and work out how to use it, you can download and install it from [GitHub](https://github.com/exercism/cli/releases/latest). However, please note that we ask that you work through the Interactive Walkthrough before opening any support requests
